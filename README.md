# searcher
mainframe search utility
At this moment, I consider how to proceed. IBMs IDz has a functionality for searching
mainframe files which is nearly identical to my planned methode.
Programming language: Java (using NetBeans), using Swing
GUI modeling: Pencil (extension: .epgz)
Target environment: z/OS PDS/Library file
================================================
Access per ZOWE CLI must be also enabled 
Project closed - too many alternatives on the market, and I have in the meanwhile no amainframe access.
